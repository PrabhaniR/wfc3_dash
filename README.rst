This is a standard package template which includes a SPHINX template that applies the STSCI branding to documentation and can be used to build documentation on ReadTheDocs or locally. 

This uses Relic to create the version number. In order for the full build, assign a version tag to your repo, then install the package using "python setup.py install". Now you can go to the docs directory and build the documentation using "make html"
